Add two new features to the existing “Guests” section of the Uklon Delivery corporate dashboard.
All styling should follow the current system design. Do not change any existing structure, components, or styles unless explicitly required by the two features below.

🧠 Feature 1: AI-Powered Summary for Restaurants
Purpose:

Help restaurant managers get instant insights into their customer base and performance without needing to interpret charts or tables.

Implementation details:

Add a “Summary” block to the top of the Analytics page (/guests/analytics) or as a separate tab inside it.

This block should fetch an AI-generated summary from the OpenAI GPT-4 API, based on key data metrics from the guest analytics (number of guests, orders, revenue, segments, activity time, etc.).

Example summary output:
This month, you had 113 active guests with 364 orders. Most revenue came from the "Parent" segment. Activity peaks between 11:00–15:00. Your average check is higher than other restaurants in Pechersk. Consider reactivating "Night users" with a dedicated evening promotion.

Technical notes:

Use fetch() or axios to make a request to a new internal API endpoint (or call OpenAI API directly from the frontend if needed).

Keep the prompt for OpenAI in the code clearly editable.

If no data is available, show placeholder text (“Summary will appear here once data is available.”).

🟡 Feature 2: Customer Status Tags (in Guest Table)
Purpose:

Allow restaurant users to instantly understand the health of each guest relationship via color-coded status tags.

Add a new column to the guest table (on /guests) called: Status.
Logic:

🟢 Active → last order was less than 14 days ago

🟡 At risk → last order was between 14 and 30 days ago

🔴 Inactive → last order was more than 30 days ago

Visuals:

Use colored pills/badges (same style as “Segment” pills).

Place the tag next to or below the “Last Order Date” column, or in a new column if layout allows.

📌 Important constraints:

Do not change any existing filters, views, cards, or logic.

Do not alter the existing marketing triggers or analytics layout.

All components should inherit the existing design system and spacing.
