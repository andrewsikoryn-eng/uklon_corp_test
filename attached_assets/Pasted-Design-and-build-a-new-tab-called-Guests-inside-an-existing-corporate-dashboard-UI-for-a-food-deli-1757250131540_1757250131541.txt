Design and build a new tab called "Guests" inside an existing corporate dashboard UI for a food delivery platform (Uklon Delivery). This new section functions as a mini-CRM for small restaurants using Uklon Delivery to manage and analyze their customers.
Use responsive layout with clear visual hierarchy and modern UI components (cards, tables, filters, buttons, etc.).
Build the interface using React + Tailwind or equivalent modern stack (or plain HTML/CSS/JS if preferred).

🧩 The "Guests" tab should include the following:
1. Main Guests Table (default view)
